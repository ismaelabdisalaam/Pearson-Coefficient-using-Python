# Using the Pearson correlation coefficient to quantify the relationship between price and the other variables
In this project we are determining which variable has the strongest correlation with price. The dataset used is obtained from the UCI Machine learning Depository.The Automobile Data Set. It is a data set that includes technical information and price data for cars from the year 1985. 
After formating the dataset, a exploratory data analysis is done on the dataset and then finally calcuating the Correlation Coeffiecient.

# Project skills: Data Cleaning,analysis and visualisation
Packages used in this project: Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn and Scipy

# Results
We find price has the strongest correlation with Engine size.
